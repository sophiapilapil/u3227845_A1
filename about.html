        <h2>WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT CANBERRA?</h2>
        <p>Canberra is a young city with a rich architectural legacy. With major boom periods in the 1920s and again
          from the 1950s-1980s – the architectural aesthetic of the city is eclectic, but deliberately cohesive.</p>

        <div class="hidden">
          <p>The mid-late twentieth century period of development in Canberra, specifically during the National Capital
            Development Commission Commission’s (NCDC) oversight (1958-1989) has not been widely celebrated or
            recognised by the Canberra community.</p>
          <p>Major developments not only in residential, but civic and community buildings saw the frequent involvement
            of architects now considered pioneers of the modernist movement, and the construction of a key collection of
            iconic and unique mid-century buildings in Australia.</p>
          <p>Many of these structures, which make an irreplaceable contribution to Canberra, have already been lost and
            many face risk of being lost in the near future.</p>
          <p>So we at Canberra Modern are here to help by engaging Canberra and Australia with their contemporary
            National Capital.</p>

          <h1>TIM ROSS</h1>
          <p>TV and radio host, comedian, author and self-confessed ‘Design Nerd’, Tim ‘Rosso’ Ross has always had a
            passion for architecture and design has advocated in this space for many years, often in new, engaging and
            hilarious ways.
            A long-time supporter of Canberra Modern, having performed several of his sell out shows within the
            festival, Tim also passionately supports important issues in Australian architecture and design and speaks
            nationally on preserving Australia’s important architectural character and the legacy of the many great
            designers of our nation.
            In 2018, Tim was awarded the National Trust Heritage Award for Advocacy and in 2019, the National
            President’s Prize from the Australian Institute of Architects, to “recognise him for his advocacy, activism
            and outstanding contribution to the architecture profession”.
            Canberra Modern are thrilled to have Tim as our Patron and look forward to many years of collaboration and
            celebration of the rich mid-century character of our National Capital. </p>
