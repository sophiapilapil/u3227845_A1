# A1 - PROJECT WEBSITE REFLECTION

### u3227845 - Sophia Pilapil

In this development process, I reflect on the different challenges and successes that I encountered while also explaining the design decisions of this my approach to this project. The first step that I did to begin was to establish the design brief. This project aimed to build a functional responsive website for Canberra Modern (CM) using HTML5 and CSS. After a client visit/consultation, Amy Jarvis and Rachel Jackson explained that the brand objective is to create awareness of the value of heritage, character and uniqueness of Canberra through event-based advocacy. Their top priority is to endorse a call to action, primarily targeting potential audiences that are unfamiliar with the cause. This step helped me understand the client's objectives to guide me throughout the whole process.

Before starting any design, I wanted to analyse CM’s current website to identify its strengths and weaknesses. Jarvis and Jackson expressed that the website is practical, however, there is nothing memorable or unique about it. The layout of the website (particularly the navigation bar) may be overwhelming to use as a lot is going on. There is also a button for users to sign in, however, there is __no option for users to sign up__ which limits the engagement of new audiences. The website is efficient in its responsiveness, which I wanted to carry onto the website that I design. Their current landing page has their logo as the hero content, and everything is centred-justified without any use of grids. This analysis helped me understand the areas of the website that need enhancing.

 I created a lo-fi prototype to brainstorm the foundational ideas that I wanted to execute. In this lo-fi prototype, I decided that I wanted to __prioritise users to join their events, sign up and have access to information easier.__ With this, I wanted to landing page to have hero content dedicated to users to join the next event, making it immediately clear what the intended action the client wants from the users. However, I did not want this to be the only content on the page because I wanted the audience to have the option to explore the page in their journey to make them feel more involved. I also believe that this will decrease the bounce rate of the website as there is more going on on the landing page. With this, I ensured that the __information on the landing page is chosen strategically in importance__ to the client, starting with the next event, a mission statement, past events, content to get users to sign up and become a Star of CM, and lastly the footer. I also wanted to minimise the number of navigation headings there will and merge some of the current headings that CM has already (i.e merging the About and the Partners page all into one). This will make the navigation bar easier to use and allow the audience to explore the website efficiently. I have also included more photos to enhance the visual interest and modernise the web design. Throughout the entire website, applied CSS __grids to create flow.__

To explore the concept further, I decided to digitally create more refined prototypes, exploring the different media sizes to discover the potential of the website. This step in the development process helped the coding process easier because this prototype was the near-final design solution that I wanted to accomplish. Following their style guide utilised all the colours in a subtle yet effective way. For example, the buttons change when the user hovers over them to __enhance discovery and feedback__. This indicates that it is different to the non-interactive content. I also used colour to highlight different content and create more of a hierarchy on the page. For example, on the Buildings Page, I used a colour textbox to emphasise the different buildings that are at risk to show its urgency. With colour, I allocated one colour for each page to create a more immersive and fun experience rather than having it all the same colour. What I changed from the previous prototype is that each page has a background image with a filled-in with their dedicated colour (noting that the landing page has no text-box fill) to create consistency throughout the website. Each page includes hero text followed by a button to enhance the call-to-action. I __limited the number of columns used for the mobile view to two to create__ a more breathable design. However, the grid orientation will vary for the desktop view to enhance the fluidity of the page. Although there are adjustments catered to the media screen, I ensured that the branding and the content are identical (i.e. images, text language, typography, and colours) to enhance brand consistency.

The website also utilises a hamburger menu when viewed on mobile but is in a horizontal navigation bar when viewed on a tablet or desktop. This is because there is no need for a hamburger menu on a wider screen as it only adds an unnecessary step and restricts the ease of the user journey. The biggest challenge I faced was when I translated this concept into coding. As someone with higher skills in design and lower/moderate coding skills, I struggled to create the responsive navigation bar because it was beyond my scope of skills. However, I decided to attempt it by watching several tutorials (which will be listed later). I found that although expanding my resources helped in understanding the concept of a responsive navigation bar, it created a challenge as I struggled to keep up with the differentiated HTML and CSS syntax and language between each tutorial. Although I give myself credit for consistently trying, the main factor in overcoming this challenge was __seeking feedback__ and help from the tutor. This feedback also allowed for the development process to be more collaborative. In the future, I would like to reach for more feedback consistently throughout the development process to create a more effective process. I would also like to reach out to not just tutors, but also recieve feedback from users of the target audience. This would have helped me identify any problems (particularly with usability) that I may have not thought of.

Reflecting, I successfully expanded my coding skills and knowledge, such as creating a parallax image, implementing a CSS Grid, the use of hero content, and most significantly, coding responsive elements. My final web design enhanced the hierarchy and organisation of the website, furhter increasing the ease of use and transparency for the users. I had no confidence in coding before this project as I had not coded in two years, and my prior knowledge was very little. By pushing myself to find additional tutorials and sources, I impressed myself with the final website solution and improved my skills.


## RESOURCES

Assemble Papers (2023). *Home Page.* [https://assemblepapers.com.au/](https://assemblepapers.com.au/)

This website inspired the design of the project for its use of images, space and grid. The landing page’s hero content’s uniqueness captured my attention immediately, which I wanted to replicate. This was the first time I noticed a parallax image and it pushed me to challenge myself to replicate that in my code. It also helped me realise that, unlike their web design, I wanted a wider outer margin to fit the content in (which can be seen in the .inner div class, to create a more simplistic look. I believe that the smaller margin width is more maximalist. I wanted to steer away from this as the target audience is older in demographic and may feel more welcomed/familiar with a more minimal/simple design.


Canberra Modern (2017). *Home Page.* [https://canberramodern.com/](https://canberramodern.com/)

As mentioned in the reflection, Canberra Modern is the first source that I started with to begin the process. By navigating my way through this website, I played the role of a user and identified any pain points that they may encounter. This was also the source that I gathered the content for the website including text and images. 


Canberra Modern: *Events. Home Page [Facebook Page].* [https://www.facebook.com/canberramodern/](https://www.facebook.com/canberramodern/)

The CM Facebook page helped me view any comments from real consumers that they have which helped me gather insights about the consumer’s brand perception. Due to the lower amount of followers, there was not much that I gathered from this, but it did help me understand the events more and gathered more images that included the consumers. I used these images in the website to show the sense of community that CM prioritises and to demonstrate the involvement that the new user could have if they signed up. 


Davies, W. (2022). *How to Make a Responsive Hamburger Menu [CSS]*. [https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css-responsive/](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css-responsive/)

This website was among the several sources that guided me in creating the responsive hamburger menu. I appreciated the step-by-step walk-through on what Davies was doing with explanations. This helped me understand the reasons for each step, rather than just copying a code without knowing what I was doing. I chose this source as it did not implement the use of JavaScript, which was beyond my skills and knowledge. I wanted to stick to just CSS and HTML because I wanted to improve my skills in that first rather than having to focus on learning JavaScript.


Walobwa, I. (2022). *Creating a responsive mobile menu with CSS without JavaScript.* [https://blog.logrocket.com/create-responsive-mobile-menu-with-css-no-javascript/](https://blog.logrocket.com/create-responsive-mobile-menu-with-css-no-javascript/)

Similar to Davies’ tutorial, Walobwa explained how to create a responsive hamburger menu in an in-depth manner that helped me understand the reasons behind each step. What I liked about this resource was that it included a live-result code, where I could change the code and see its impact. It also went further in-depth in the reasons behind each step, which was both helpful yet at times overwhelming.
