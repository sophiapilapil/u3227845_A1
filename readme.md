In this development process, I reflect on the different challenges and successes that I encountered while also explaining the design decisions of this my approach to this project. The first step that I did to begin was to establish the design brief. The aim of this project was to build a functional responsive website for Canberra Modern  (CM) using HTML5 and CSS. After a client visit/consultation, Amy Jarvis and Rachel Jackson explained that the brand objective is to create awareness of the value of heritage, character and uniqueness of Canberra through event-based advocacy. Their top priority is to endorse a call to action, primarily targeting potential audiences that are unfamiliar with the cause. This step helped me understand the client's objectives to guide me throughout the whole process.

Before starting any design, I wanted to analyse CMâ€™s current website to identify its strengths and weaknesses. Jarvis and Jackson expressed that the website is practical, however, there is nothing memorable or unique about it. The layout of the website (particularly the navigation bar) may be overwhelming to use as a lot is going on. There is also a button for users to sign in, however, there is no option for users to sign up which limits the engagement of new audiences. The website is efficient in its responsiveness, which I wanted to carry onto the website that I design. Their current landing page has their logo as the hero content, and everything is centred-justified without any use of grids. This analysis helped me understand the areas of the website that need enhancing.

With this analysis, I wanted to prioritise the hierarchy and organisation of the website to enhance the ease of use and transparency for the users. I created a lo-fi prototype to brainstorm the foundational ideas that I wanted to execute. In this lo-fi prototype, I decided that I wanted to prioritise users to join their events, sign up and have access to information easier. With this, I wanted to landing page to have hero content dedicated to users to join the next event, making it immediately clear what the intended action the client wants from the users. However, I did not want this to be the only content on the page because I wanted the audience to have the option to explore the page in their journey to make them feel like they have more control. I also believe that this will decrease the bounce rate of the website as there is more going on on the landing page. With this, I ensured that the information on the landing page is chosen strategically in importance to the client, starting with the next event, a mission statement, past events and perhaps a chance for the users to submit their own images or content. I believe that this will make more of a community and enhance the attraction for users to sign up. I also wanted to minimise the number of navigation headings there will and merge some of the current headings that CM has already (i.e merging the About and the Partners page all into one). This will make the navigation bar easier to use and allow the audience to explore the website efficiently. I have also included more photos to enhance the visual interest and modernise the web design. Throughout the entire website, applied CSS grids to create flow.

To explore the concept further, I decided to digitally create more refined prototypes, exploring the different media sizes to discover the potential of the website. This step in the development process helped the coding process easier because this prototype was the near-final design solution that I wanted to accomplish. Following their style guide utilised all the colours in a subtle yet effective way. For example, the buttons change when the user hovers over them to enhance discovery and feedback. This indicates that it is different to the non-interactive content. I also used colour to highlight different content and create more of a hierarchy on the page. For example, on the Buildings Page, I used a colour textbox to emphasise the different buildings that are at risk to show its urgency. With colour, I allocated one colour for each page to create a more immersive and fun experience rather than having it all the same colour. What I changed from the previous prototype is that each page has a background image with a filled-in with their dedicated colour (noting that the landing page has no text-box fill) to create consistency throughout the website. Each page includes hero text followed by a button to enhance the call-to-action. I limited the number of columns used for the mobile view to two to create a more breathable design. However, the grid orientation will vary for the desktop view to enhance the fluidity of the page. Although there are adjustments catered to the media screen, I ensured that the branding and the content are identical (i.e. images, text language, typography, and colours) to enhance brand consistency.

The website also utilises a hamburger menu when viewed on mobile but is in a horizontal navigation bar when viewed on a tablet or desktop. This is because there is no need for a hamburger menu on a wider screen. After all, it only adds an unnecessary step and restricts the ease of the user journey. The biggest challenge I faced was when I translated this concept into coding. As someone with higher skills in design and lower/moderate coding skills, I struggled to create the responsive navigation bar because it was beyond my scope of skills. However, I decided to attempt it by watching several tutorials (which will be listed later). I found that although expanding my resources helped in understanding the concept of a responsive navigation bar, it created a challenge as I struggled to keep up with the differentiated HTML and CSS syntax and language between each tutorial. Although I give myself credit for consistently trying, the main factor in overcoming this challenge was seeking feedback and help from the tutor. This feedback also allowed for the development process to be more collaborative. In the future, I would like to reach for more feedback consistently throughout the development process to create a more effective process. I would also like to reach out to not just tutors, but also to test out the website usability with potential users of the demographic. This would have helped me identify any problems that I may have not thought of.

Reflecting, I successfully expanded my coding skills and knowledge, such as creating a parallax image, implementing a CSS Grid, the use of hero content, and most significantly, coding responsive elements. I had no confidence in coding before this project as I had not coded in two years, and my prior knowledge was very little. By pushing myself to find additional tutorials and sources, I impressed myself with the final website solution and improved my skills.
